Machine learning is a subset of artificial intelligence focused on the development of algorithms that improve automatically through experience and by the use of data. Machine learning algorithms build a model based on sample data, known as training data, in order to make predictions or decisions without being explicitly programmed to do so. A neural network is a computing system loosely inspired by the biological neural networks that constitute animal brains. Such systems progressively improve their performance on a specific task with data.

Artificial intelligence is intelligence demonstrated by machines, in contrast to the natural intelligence displayed by humans and animals. AI applications include advanced web search engines, recommendation systems used by YouTube, Amazon, and Netflix, understanding human speech, self-driving cars, automated decision-making, and competing at the highest level in strategic game systems.

Deep learning is part of a broader family of machine learning methods based on artificial neural networks with representation learning. Learning can be supervised, semi-supervised or unsupervised. Deep-learning architectures such as deep neural networks, deep belief networks, and recurrent neural networks have been applied to fields including computer vision, speech recognition, natural language processing, audio recognition, social network filtering, machine translation, bioinformatics, and drug design, where they have produced results comparable to and in some cases surpassing human expert performance.

Quantum computing is the use of quantum-mechanical phenomena such as superposition and entanglement to perform computation. Computers that perform quantum computations are known as quantum computers. This field began in the 1980s and is a rapidly advancing interdisciplinary area that includes research in physics, computer science, and mathematics.
