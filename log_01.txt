Yes, Turnitin has significant shortcomings in semantic and stylometric analysis, and
emerging technologies—including deep learning, topic-debiasing, and advanced
feature extraction—can outperform Turnitin in detecting nuanced authorship and
semantic similarity.
1. Introduction
Turnitin is widely used in academic settings as a text-matching tool to detect potential plagiarism, but research
consistently highlights its limitations in both semantic and stylometric analysis. Specifically, Turnitin often fails to
recognize domain-specific semantics, such as technical jargon or context-dependent phrases, leading to inflated
similarity scores and misjudgments, as seen in agricultural extension writing in Nigeria (Emmanuel et al., 2023).
Moreover, Turnitin's reliance on surface-level text matching makes it vulnerable to paraphrasing and stylometric
obfuscation, where changes in writing style or structure can bypass detection (Emmanuel et al., 2023; Mphahlele &
McKenna, 2019). Recent advances in...
