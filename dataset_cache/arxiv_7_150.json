  "Learning the past tense of English verbs - a seemingly minor aspect of language acquisition - has generated heated debates since 1986, and has become a landmark task for testing the adequacy of cognitive modeling",
  "An alternative solution is to generate first a candidate base program which covers the positive examples, and then make it consistent by inserting cut where appropriate",
  "A conceptual framework for cluster analysis from the viewpoint of p-adic geometry is introduced by describing the space of all dendrograms for n datapoints and relating it to the moduli space of p-adic Riemannian spheres with punctures using a method recently applied by Murtagh",
  "Oblique decision tree methods are tuned especially for domains in which the attributes are numeric, although they can be adapted to symbolic or mixed symbolic/numeric attributes",
